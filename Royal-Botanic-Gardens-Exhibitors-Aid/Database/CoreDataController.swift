Ferns are one of the first plants to re-generate after hot wild fires that kill many other plants. Over the last ten years Fern Gully has suffered from pressures of drought, 30,000 roosting flying foxes, and failing infrastructure. As a result a Fern Gully restoration project is now in place that aims to reverse this trend through a total management approach that considers issues of public amenity, accessibility, tree health, and water quality, over a Three Stage process.", exhibitionLat:  -37.831455, exhibitionLon: 144.980478, icon: "forest").0
